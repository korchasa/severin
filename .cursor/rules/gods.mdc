## Clear and Precise Task Setting
> PROJECT MODE: PoC — tasks should target minimal viable functionality first.

Use GODS to create and write issues/tasks.

- **G — Goal:**
  Why are we performing the task? What is the business goal?

- **O — Overview:**
  What is happening now? Why did the task arise? What is happening around it?

- **D — Definition of Done:**
  When do we consider the task completed? By what criteria?

- **S — Solution:**
  How can the task be solved?
